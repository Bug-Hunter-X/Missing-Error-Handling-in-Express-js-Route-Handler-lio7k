This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the route handler attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without checking for errors. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a number. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
